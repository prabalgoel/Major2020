We were successful in our project by finding the top influential people based on the category country and product description which the brand itself provided to our model.
For the prediction we used cosine similarity which was successful in providing the best influencers.
We used a count factorizer to formulate the array and to form this array we provided the post description variable of every influencers which formed the basis for finding cosine similarity.

We were able to find the name, total_videos, average_videos_views, average_videos_comments, total_posts, average_post_comments, average_post_likes, description, tagged_names, country, category. All these features are important for predictions algorithms so we stored all the data in a CSV file, so that it can act as a tool to the program such that we can analyze the data and find the most influential person which can help the brand for a better chance of marketing.
